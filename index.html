                        <div class="para1">
                            <p>As of October 2021, Daniel Ricciardo is widely regarded as one of the most popular Australian Formula 1 drivers in the sport's 70 year history. In his younger years, he was seen as a definite championship contender, but a reputation for team-swtiching in the past few years alongisde a flurry of lacklaster results at <span class="mcl" styles>McLaren</span> in 2021 - has many questioning whether the Honey Badger "has still got it".</p>
                            <p>Within his decade-long career, Ricciardo has spent his time accross five seperate teams - most notably: <span class='rb'>Red Bull Racing</span>, where he very much grew up and was the poster boy for the team and even the entire F1.</p>
                            <p>Many fans, with the power of hindsight, condemn Ricciardo's shock decision to move to <span class='ren'>Renault</span> in 2019, attributing his poor post-2018 performance to weak cars and constructors. </p>
                            <p>The chart on the right, displays all of Ricciardo's races even from his beginnings at <span class='hrt'>HRT</span> and <span class='tor'>Toro Rosso</span>, up until his performance now. Looking at the general trend over the past few years, he very much seems to have somewhat stagnated, thus the alleged "drop" in his skill and performance may very well be a product of exaggeration.</p>

                    <p>Formula One, known for it's blinding speeds, daredevil drivers and beautiful tracks all around the world present new challenges and ever-changing environments to each team and driver throughout their career. The following is an exploration of Ricciardo's dominance in different parts of the world. The size of the mark represents how often Ricciardo has placed in the top 5 relative to the track, whereas the colour displays with which constructor Ricciardo has had the most success per track. </p>
                    <p>As can be seen the data is largely skewed in favour of his <span class="rb">Red Bull</span> days, likely due to the fact he spent half his career with them.</p>

                        <h2>An Obvious Relative Dip</h2>
                        <div class="para3" style="margin-right: 30px">
                            <p>Ricciardo's career has largely been overshadowed by the absolute dominance of <span class="merc">Mercedes</span> and <span class="merc">Lewis Hamilton</span> in the past 7 years, with 7 constructor's championships as well as the 7 driver's championships belonging to them. Lewis as the benchmark, we see that Daniel wasn't far off in 2016 and 2017 as he seemingly put up a fight against the champ. </p>
                            <p>However, a fairer compairson can be made between Ricciardo and his teenage sensation teammate between 2016-2018: <span class="rb">Max Verstappen</span>. We see that by 2018, Max has started to outshine Daniel, arguably a product of team favouring. Nevertheless, the move to <span class='ren'>Renault</span> in 2019 as seen on the graph, rightfully seemed to do very little for his post-2017 decline. </p>
                            <p>Now at <span class="mcl">McLaren</span>, just halfway into the year, Ricciardo has already mustered the same amount of podiums as the two forgetable years with <span class='ren'>Renault</span> as fans can finally start being optimistic for the return of the Honey Badger.</p>

                        <div class='para3'>
                        <p>Due to the large imbalance between constructor budgets and technologies, they say the fairest measure of a Formula One driver can be seen through how they stack up against their teammate - who undoubtedly races with all the same equipment and technology.</p>
                        <p>Ricciardo has had the pleasure (...or displeasure) of racing with past and future superstars of Formula One as teammates. Amongst these, are notably, <span class='rb'>Sebastian Vettel (2014)</span>, <span class='rb'>Max Verstappen (2015-2018)</span> and now <span class='mcl'>Lando Norris (2021-)</span>.</p>
                        <p>The area chart displays the amount of times Daniel <span style="color:#6DE4D1">has gotten the better of a teammate</span> in a race as opposed to when <span style="color:#E46D7F">his teammate has gotten the better of him</span>.</p>
                        <p>2016-2018 beautifully displays the rise of <span class='rb'>Verstappen</span> against the fall of Daniel. 2018-2020 sees Daniel mostly having the better of his teammates at <span class='ren'>Renault</span>. And laslty, we see that Daniel has a problem on his hands this year in dealing with <span class="mcl">Norris</span>.</p>
